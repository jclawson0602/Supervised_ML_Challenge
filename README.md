Supervised Machine Learning Challenge Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
The purpose of our analysis is to determine whether a logistic regression model trained on historical lending activity gathered from a peer-to-peer lending services company can be used to identify the creditworthiness of our borrowers.

The Results of Our Report:

•	Accuracy Score: For all our model’s observations, it is correct 99% of the time in predicting whether a loan is truly healthy or has a high risk of defaulting.  
•	Precision Score: For all loans classified correctly and incorrectly as being healthy, our model is 100% precise in predicting healthy loans correctly. And for all loans classified correctly and incorrectly as high-risk, our model is 85% precise in predicting high-risk loans correctly.  
•	Recall Score: For all predicted loans classified correctly as healthy and incorrectly as high-risk, our model is 99% correct in predicting healthy loans correctly. And for all predicted loans classified correctly as high-risk and incorrectly as healthy, our model is 91% correct in predicting high-risk loans correctly.

I would be hesitant to recommend this model to our company without further testing because of how perfect our accuracy, precision, and recall scores seem to be. Having our model accuracy being so close to 100% does not seem realistic. I would recommend that our teamwork with different classification models like Decision Trees, Random-Forest, and Support Vector Machines before implementing our findings with Logistic Regression.
